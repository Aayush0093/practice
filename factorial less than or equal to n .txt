A number n is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.

class Solution {
  public:
  
    vector<long long> factorialNumbers(long long n) {
        // Write Your Code here
        vector<long long> v;
        int fact = 1;
        int i,j;
        for(i = 1; i <=n ; i++){
            fact *= i;
            v.push_back(fact);
            
            if(v[i-1]>n){
                v.pop_back();
                // break;
            }
        }
        
        return v;
    }
