Given an integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number
Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

class Solution {
  public:
    long long int floorSqrt(long long int n) {
        // Your code goes here
        
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        
        while(low<=high){
            
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            
            if(mid*mid<=n){
                low=mid+1;
            }else{
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        
        return high;
        
    }
