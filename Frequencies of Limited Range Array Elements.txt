Frequencies of Limited Range Array Elements
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 27.64%Submissions: 269K+Points: 2
Given an array arr[] of n positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to p where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array.
Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers from 1 to n. Do modify the array in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i) and assume 1-based indexing.

Note: The elements greater than n in the array can be ignored for counting. 


class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N in the array.
    void frequencyCount(vector<int>& arr,int N, int P)
    { 
        // code here
        unordered_map <int,int> mpp;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++)
            mpp[arr[i]]++;
            
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++){
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++)
            arr[i] = mpp[i+1];
    }
};
